ls -la dist/
```

### **Step 2: Create Release Build**
```bash
# Option A: Try full production build (may need admin privileges)
npm run build:production

# Option B: Manual build if permissions issue
npx tsc -b && npx vite build
npx electron-builder --dir  # Creates unpacked version for testing
```

### **Step 3: Test the Application**

- [ ] Check performance with large files
- [ ] Test theme switching
- [ ] Verify all UI components render correctly

### **Step 4: Create Distribution Package**

npx electron-builder

# Alternative: Create portable version
npx electron-builder --win portable
```

### **Step 5: Final Verification**
- [ ] Install the application from the installer
- [ ] Test on a clean system (if possible)
- [ ] Verify all features work in installed version
- [ ] Check file associations and shortcuts
