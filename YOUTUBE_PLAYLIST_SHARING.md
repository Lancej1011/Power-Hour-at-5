### Common Issues

**Q: My share code doesn't work**

**Q: I can't see my shared playlist in the community**
A: Make sure you marked it as "public" when sharing. Private playlists only work with direct share codes.

**Q: Import failed with "Invalid playlist data"**
A: The playlist may be corrupted or from an incompatible version. Try asking the creator to re-share.

**Q: Ratings aren't updating**
A: Ratings are calculated locally. Make sure you've imported the playlist before rating it.
