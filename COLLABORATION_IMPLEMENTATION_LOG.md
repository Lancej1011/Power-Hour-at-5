  - User presence tracking and management
  - Collaborator management (add/remove/permissions)
- **Collections Defined**:
  - `collaborative_playlists` - Main playlist data
  - `collaboration_invitations` - Invitation management
  - `playlist_operations` - Operation history for conflict resolution
  - `collaboration_events` - Real-time events
  - `user_presence` - Live user presence and cursors

### **‚úÖ Task 1.3: Collaboration Store (Zustand)** - COMPLETED
- **File Created**: `src/stores/collaborationStore.ts`
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Complete Zustand store with immer and devtools
  - Real-time state management for collaborative playlists

## **üîß Technical Architecture Implemented**

### **Data Flow**
```
User Action ‚Üí Zustand Store ‚Üí Firebase Service ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Real-time Listeners ‚Üí Store Update ‚Üí UI Update
```

### **Key Design Decisions**
1. **Operational Transformation**: Using vector clocks and operation dependencies for conflict resolution
2. **Real-time Sync**: Firebase real-time listeners for instant updates
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Local state updates before Firebase confirmation
4. **Permission System**: Three-tier system (owner/editor/viewer)
5. **Presence Tracking**: Real-time user cursors and activity indicators

### **Firebase Collections Structure**
```
/collaborative_playlists/{playlistId}
  - Complete playlist data with collaborator info
  - Real-time sync for all changes

/playlist_operations/{operationId}
  - Individual operations for conflict resolution
  - Vector clocks for ordering

/user_presence/{playlistId}_{userId}
  - Live user cursors and activity
  - Automatic cleanup on disconnect
```

## **üéØ Next Steps**

1. **Implement Live Synchronization** (Task 2.1)
   - Create operation transformation logic
   - Add conflict resolution algorithms
   - Implement optimistic updates

2. **Build User Presence System** (Task 2.2)
   - Real-time cursor tracking
   - Activity notifications
   - User status management

3. **Create Collaboration UI** (Task 3.1)
   - Collaborative playlist editor component
   - User presence indicators
   - Real-time notification system

## **üîç Ready to Continue**

The core infrastructure is now complete and ready for Phase 2 implementation. All TypeScript interfaces, Firebase services, and Zustand stores are in place to support real-time collaborative playlist editing.

**Current Status**: Ready to implement live synchronization and user presence features.
